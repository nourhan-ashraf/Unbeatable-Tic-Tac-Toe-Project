# Unbeatable-Tic-Tac-Toe-Project

### **Objectives:**

Our team (Error-404 Team) project that aims to develop an Un-Beatable Tic-Tac-Toe game using AI and that AI can never lose against any human player 
and tie is its worest case. Using MiniMax algorisim we made something for the program like a cheat code that will make it never lose at any case.
If you don't know what is Tic-Tac-To just follow me:

### **What is Tic-Tac Toe:**

It's a game in which two players alternately put Xs and Os in a 3x3 board in compartments of a figure formed by two vertical lines 
crossing two horizontal lines and each tries to get a row of three Xs or three Os before the opponent does.

**And this is an example from  the game in which a player won for connecting a diagonal:**

### **How Tic-Tac Toe is played:**

1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.

2. You are X, your friend (or the computer in this case) is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.

3. The first player to get 3 of his marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.

4. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.
