# Unbeatable-Tic-Tac-Toe-Project

This project aims to build an Unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe game using artificial intelligence.

Computer can never lose against any human player and tie is its worst case.

We used Minimax algorithm to develop this code.


### **What is Tic-Tac Toe?**

It's a game in which two players alternately put Xs and Os in a 3x3 board in compartments of a figure formed by two vertical lines 
crossing two horizontal lines and each tries to get a row of three Xs or three Os before the opponent does.
